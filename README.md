Wrote the manufacture() template method in the Coin class to simulate the manufacturing process.

Created individual process step methods, with some methods being abstract and others having default implementations.

Ensured proper access control (public, protected, private, final) to prevent misuse of the Coin class.

Updated unit tests to reflect changes in how coins are manufactured.

Built a Demo class that shows coin creation and how dashboards update automatically after manufacturing.

Ensured all code meets Checkstyle standards and includes unit tests.
