Explored the CelsiusConverter example code to understand Java Swing GUIs.

Created a CoinCounts class and composed it inside the Coin class.

Made the CoinCounts object a protected static field inside Coin.

Added a TotalCoins dashboard observer that updates when coins are created.

Added a QuarterCounter dashboard observer that tracks the number of quarters.

Updated concrete Coin classes to call methods on CoinCounts (e.g., incrementQuarter()).

Built a Demo class that demonstrates coin creation and automatic dashboard updates.

Ensured all code meets Checkstyle standards and includes unit tests.
